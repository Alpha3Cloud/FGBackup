# Fortinet Firewall Automated Backup Platform

## Overview
This platform automates configuration backups for FortiGate firewalls, making it simple to schedule, track, and manage backup operations across multiple devices.

## Features
- **Device Management**
  - Auto-discovery or manual device import
  - Secure encrypted credential storage
  - Device grouping (per region, site, or customer)

- **Backup Scheduling**
  - Custom cron-like schedules per device/group
  - On-demand backups
  - Pre/post-backup hooks for validation and alerts

- **Backup Methods**
  - **SSH CLI**: Run commands like `show full-configuration`, export configs
  - **SCP**: Execute `backup config` and pull files via SCP
  - **FortiOS REST API**: Use `/monitor/system/config/backup` with tokens
  - **FortiManager Integration**: Trigger managed device backups
  - Optional Git integration for version tracking

- **Storage & Retention**
  - Local NAS/SAN, Cloud (S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage)
  - Encrypted archives with configurable retention policies

- **Notifications & Tracking**
  - Dashboard with status, timestamps, and logs
  - Email, Slack, or Teams alerts for failures
  - Weekly or monthly compliance reports

- **Restore & Rollback**
  - One-click restore via API or SSH
  - Diff comparison before restore
  - Version history tracking

- **User Interface**
  - Web-based dashboard (optional full platform)
  - Role-based access control (RBAC)
  - Searchable logs and history

## Implementation Options

### Option 1: Lightweight Script + Scheduler
- **Tech stack**: Python (Paramiko for SSH, Boto3 for S3), Cron (Linux) or Task Scheduler (Windows)
- Best for environments with <50 devices
- Runs as a simple job to pull configs and upload to storage

### Option 2: Full Web-Based Platform
- **Tech stack**: Python (Flask/Django), PostgreSQL/MySQL, React/Vue frontend
- Scalable for >100 devices
- Features include scheduling, monitoring, reporting, role-based access

### Option 3: Existing Tools
- **RANCID or Oxidized**: Open-source network config backup tools
- **FortiManager**: Built-in backup and export capabilities, API triggers
- Great if infrastructure already exists, less flexible for custom needs

## Additional Enhancements
- Config change diffing and alerts
- Multi-tenant support for MSPs
- SIEM integration for logging and compliance
- High Availability for backup platform

## Next Steps
1. Select an implementation approach (lightweight script, full web app, or integration with existing tools).
2. Configure storage and retention policies.
3. Implement monitoring and alerting workflows.
